Description: The 'EIX' package supports structure mining from 'XGBoost' and 'LightGBM' models.
    Key functionalities of this package cover: visualisation of tree-based ensembles models,
    identification of interactions, measuring of variable importance,
    measuring of interaction importance, explanation of single prediction 
    with break down plots (based on 'xgboostExplainer' and 'breakDown' packages).
    'EIX' is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe.
