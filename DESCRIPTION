Description:The `EIX` package is the set of tools to structure mining of XGBoost and LightGBM models.This package enables to find interactions in the model and also to measure variables' and interactions' importance. It includes the function of model visualization in such way that the most important variables and interactions are visible. It is also possible to analyze the prediction of a single observation taking into account the interactions. The last functionality was built using the `xgboostExplainer` and `breakDown` package.
