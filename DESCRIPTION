Description: The EIX package supports structure mining from XGBoost and LightGBM models.
    Key functionalities of this package cover: viualisation of tree-based ensembles models,
    identification of interactions, measuring of variable importance,
    measuring of interaction importance, explanation of single prediction 
    with break down plots (based on xgboostExplainer and breakDown packages).
